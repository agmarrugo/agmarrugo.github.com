    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So, I was preparing my clases for the upcoming semester and I wanted to produce an outline of the lectures with the corresponding date and topic. For instance I have a class that’s once a week every Friday. I could look up the calendar and write every date, which is what I initially did. But then I though, I could write a script for this. And that’s when I entered the rabbit hole.<sup id="fnref:fn1"><a href="#fn:fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>The script I’m showing here went through several iterations. I had several difficulties until I got it to work. I wasn’t pleased with it, so I fiddled a bit more. Later when I saw Dr Drang’s post about <a href="http://leancrew.com/all-this/2016/01/formatting-multimarkdown-tables-with-numpy-and-tabulate/" title="Formatting MultiMarkdown tables with NumPy and tabulate - All this">formatting multimarkdown tables with tabulate</a>, I knew I had to use that. So I did. Here’s the script.</p>

<p>As you can see, the script is quite simple. I give it the year and the months. The loops go over the months, and then the weeks and it looks up the friday of that week. On line 18, I have to append the white spaces <code>" "</code> and convert day to <code>str</code> in order to get three columns per day, so that tabulate gives me back a nifty formatted table. Another cool thing is that tabulate can also output in LaTeX format.</p>

<p>The script will produce this:</p>

<pre><code>| Date   | Lecture   | Lecture Topics   |
|:-------|:----------|:-----------------|
| Feb 5  |           |                  |

<p>As you can see it works. However, by now you’re wondering, but what about holidays. The script should be smart enough to exclude holidays. I am implementing this, but I’ll leave it for a future post. When rendered looks something like this:</p>

<p>Despite all the tools and applications at my disposal, I like to write my comments, feedback and grade the lab reports I get from my students using plain text files. To be precise, <a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/" title="Daring Fireball: Markdown">markdown</a> formatted plain text files md.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>I typically write in a plain text file using <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/" title="nvALT - BrettTerpstra.com">nvalt</a> or <a href="https://macromates.com/" title="TextMate — The Missing Editor for Mac OS X">textmate</a> as my text editor. With the help of a <a href="https://smilesoftware.com/TextExpander/index.html" title="TextExpander: Mac Typing Shortcut Utility Saves You Time TextExpander: Mac Typing Shortcut Utility Saves You Time">TextExpander</a> snippet I print out the class list and the other fields I must fill out, typically a general comment/feedback and the grade. The snippet produces something like this:<sup id="fnref:fn1"><a href="#fn:fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>After filling it out I get something like the following:</p>

<pre><code>tags:#vision,#lab

- Pérez Ramos, Miguel A.
	- Comentario: El informe está completo y bien argumentado. Se demuestra que se realizó la práctica a cabalidad. Concluye adecuadamente y cita las referencias consultadas.
	- Nota: 5.0

- Beleño Hernández, Liliana P.
	- Comentario: El informe comienza bien, pero termina abruptamente. No se mencionan los aspectos relacionados con la lectura y tampoco se evidencia adecuadamente los resultados de la práctica. No hay bibliografía.
	- Nota: 3.5

- Carrascal Mendez, Martín S.
	- Comentario: El informe es adecuado y cumple con el objetivo de la práctica.
	- Nota: 5.0	
</code></pre>

<p>This is easy to fill out, looks nice and is well formated. I can preview it - if I want – in <a href="http://marked2app.com/" title="Marked 2 - Smarter tools for smarter writers">Marked</a> or in any other markdown previewer. But the truth is, I’m fine viewing it just like that in plain text. The tedious part comes when I need to copy the grades from this file to a spreadsheet.</p>

<p>This is where <a href="https://automatetheboringstuff.com/" title="Automate the Boring Stuff with Python - Practical Programming for Total Beginners">automating the boring stuff</a> in python makes this a fun and interesting problem to spend an evening solving with a script. The following script takes an input text file formatted like the one previously shown.</p>

<p>The usage is very simply, you just call the script <code>grades2csv.py</code> with the file you want to process. If you don’t specify where the output should go (<code>-o option</code>) it defaults to the same path as the input text file.</p>

<p>I didn’t bother on avoiding overwriting an existing csv file with the same name. I never name two text files with grades the same way.</p>

<p>About a year ago, I found out about this awesome trick of setting up a <code>REMatcher class</code> so that I can have an object that saves the matched string and returns <code>True</code> when it matches the regex. I’ve never gone back to implementing other regex paraphernalia in python. This works and I stick with it.</p>

<p>The script looks for three different matches in every line of the input file. One for a line that starts with a dash (<code>^-(.*$)</code>), capturing the name of the student (<code>m.group(1)</code>). The second, that matches the word <code>Comentario</code>(<code>"^\t.*-.*Comentario:(.*$)"</code>) and captures the comment, and the third that captures the grade (<code>"^\t.*-.*Nota:\s*(\d.*$)"</code>). If the grade is not captured, then not a single item is written to the csv file (<code>wr.writerow(List)</code>).</p>

<p>If everything is well formated in the input file. The output is a nicely formatted csv file:</p>

<pre><code>"Nombre","Nota","Comentario"
" Pérez Ramos, Miguel A.","5.0"," El informe está completo y bien argumentado. Se demuestra que se realizó la práctica a cabalidad. Concluye adecuadamente y cita las referencias consultadas."
" Beleño Hernández, Liliana P.","3.5"," El informe comienza bien, pero termina abruptamente. No se mencionan los aspectos relacionados con la lectura y tampoco se evidencia adecuadamente los resultados de la práctica. No hay bibliografía."
" Carrascal Mendez, Martín S.","5.0"," El informe es adecuado y cumple con el objetivo de la práctica."
" Piñeres De La Rosa, Néstor N.","4.7"," El marco teórico apunta a lo necesario, pero con las citas correspondientes. Muy bien por utilizar otras imágenes. Los comentarios son oportunos. Una discusión un poco más extensa sobre los distintos tipos de filtros que se implementaron en la última parte es deseable, ""prewitt"", ""sobel"", etc."
" Daza Beltran, Juan A.","3.5"," El informe se ajusta a lo mínimo. Debería tener una discusión de resultados más extensa u observaciones del proceso de filtrado con diferentes filtros. Termina abruptamente. No hay bibliografía."
</code></pre>

<p>Which looks like this when viewed as a spreadsheet:</p>

<p>You might be wondering, but why go through all this trouble. Because I can, but mostly because I find spreadsheets useful, but I don’t like typing data into them. I find it more productive to write continuously in a plain text file. I can use Textexpander and other tools more easily. And finally, why not let the computer do the work it’s supposed to do - I’m no monkey.</p>

<p>We often live worrying about the future and longing for a less troublesome past; like when we were kids. I know that not everyone had a <em>perfect</em> childhood. I certainly did not, but I still had my moments in which my joy was true and worry free. Those moments are precious to me. </p>

<p>Adulthood has many upsides when viewed from a teenager’s perspective; the opposite is also true. If only they could talk to each other. </p>

<p>She likes to do most things as <em>fast</em> as possible. </p>

<p>I think that if you do things too quickly you might not be fully aware of what you’re doing. </p>

<p>You might feel that you are not really in charge of your life. </p>

<p>You might feel that you can’t  really remember things truly. </p>

<p>Like nothing becomes a memorable experience. </p>

<p>You have no time for metacognition and self-awareness. </p>

<p>I wrote these lines before finding out about this book <a href="http://www.carlhonore.com/books/in-praise-of-slowness/" title="In Praise of Slow | Carl Honoré">In Praise of Slow by Carl Honoré.</a> It seems this has inspired the slow-movement which tries to raise awareness of how we need to take it easy and enjoy life.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote>
  <p>My favorite topic in an introductory differential equations course is mechanical and electrical vibrations. I enjoyed learning about it as a student and I enjoyed teaching it later. (Or more accurately, I enjoyed being exposed to it as a student and really learning it later when I had to teach it.)</p>

<p>I’ve always thought that education is about learning, as much as parenting is about maturing and growing up. On the parenting side, you can’t really teach your kids how to live – <a href="http://www.radiolab.org/story/288746-future-cant-control/" title="A Future You Can't Control - Radiolab">you can’t even imagine the kind of world they will have to live from the time they’re born</a> – but you <em>can</em> expose them to the best things you know. In doing so, they can at least have the chance to form an opinion on the many matters of life, they’ll surely make mistakes, but I bet they won’t regret much. </p>

<p>Education is a difficult topic. Everyone has something to say about it, yet no one seems to have true answers. I do think that education is much more about being exposed to something, rather than being taught that something. There’s an incredible difference between the two things.  </p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2014/12/two-little-date-commands/">Dr. Drang recently shared</a> two date commands he uses for: i) calculating how many days have passed since a given date, and ii) another that returns the day of the year of the current date. </p>

<p>I was mainly interested in the first one because I often have to do that calculation.<sup id="fnref:fn1"><a href="#fn:fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Because the script can also compute the days remaining until a future date, you can imagine how handy it can be. For instance, if I’d like to know how many days until the day I start my vacations, I just run the script with a future date and it’ll return a negative result in days. Or if I’d like to know how old I am in days.</p>

This is how old I am in days.</div>

<p>I thought it would be something useful to have on my iPhone so I turned it into a <a href="http://omz-software.com/pythonista/" title="Pythonista">Pythonista</a> script that I run from <a href="http://agiletortoise.com/drafts/" title="Drafts - Agile Tortoise">Drafts</a>. If you want to know exactly what the script does go to <a href="http://www.leancrew.com/all-this/2014/12/two-little-date-commands/">Dr. Drang’s post</a>, I just modified it a bit so that it runs from Drafts when you enter a date in the following format <code>DD MM YY</code> where <code>YY</code> is optional, it assumes current year. </p>

<p>You can download the <code>ago.py</code> script from <a href="https://gist.github.com/agmarrugo/e74853dd3914513af1d2">this gist.</a> The Drafts action is available <a href="http://drafts4-actions.agiletortoise.com/a/1PP">here.</a></p>

<p>A Ph.D. thesis is one of those things that has a life of its own. Last January, I had the opportunity to write a two-page abstract of my thesis for publication in <em>Electronic Letters on Computer Vision and Image Analysis</em>. It has been published and is now <a href="http://elcvia.cvc.uab.es/article/view/597" title="Retinal Image Analysis Oriented to the Clinical Task - Marrugo - Electronic Letters on Computer Vision and Image Analysis">available on the web along with the PhD thesis.</a></p>

<p>The paper is only a glimpse of all the hard work that went into the making of the thesis, but anyone who reads it may get a decent idea of what it is about, and where to find the results I’ve published in different journals. I don’t think anyone wants to go through the process of writing a thesis twice, but most will agree that it is a life changing experience. Many of the best moments of my life so far, happened while working towards the PhD, especially the birth of my two boys. </p>

    <id>http://andresmarrugo.net/blog/2014/01/31/not-collapsing-the-wave-function</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today in <a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/399/contents-unknown" title="Contents Unknown | This American Life">“This American Life”</a> I was listening to an episode about hidden truths. It was really interesting to find out about a secret letter that the prime minister of Britain writes to every commander of a nuclear submarine. It supposedly contains instructions on what to do if the nation has been wiped out and if the commander should retaliate or not. It poses a mystery on what the contents are, even more so because every time there’s a new prime minister in office the letters are destroyed unread.</p>

<p>There are many questions that come about in knowing what the contents of the letter are. But to my understanding it is a way of reassuring your people that both possibilities exist. To retaliate or not. It is like delaying the final call on a difficult decision. Something akin to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schrodinger_cat" title="Schrödinger's cat - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">Schrödinger cat situation</a>.  </p>

<p>I’ve thought of this for while and I’ve come to understand that many people actually <em>like</em> to live their lives this way. Not wanting to know certain things, or more precisely clinging to the hope that a certain aspect in one’s life does not turn out to be what we fear so much. Keeping both options open (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function" title="Wave function - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia"><em>not collapsing the wave function</em></a>) is probably a reassuring situation, relieving anxiety and allowing one to continue living unmoved by the cold hard reality. </p>

<p>All too often I see people who simply talk too much.<sup id="fnref:fn1"><a href="#fn:fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Wether what they speak is nonsense or <em>even</em> meaningful things, there’s a limit to how much one can tolerate. </p>

<p>By talking too much –  and too often – we miss out on many things. We don’t let others speak (which to my understanding is common courtesy), and worse of all we lose our capacity to empathize with others. We can’t <em>read faces</em> well while uttering words out of our mouths continuously. Loosing that feedback is what prompts us to speak without pause and with no care for what the people around us may feel. It’s what turns you into a prick. We’re just <em>too</em> focused on ourselves to care about others. </p>

<!-- more -->

<p>Having no feedback at all is dangerous, it really is. You tend to get the feeling that you’re always right. Usually, people are too polite to interrupt you and <a href="http://contentmarketingsuite.com/actionbar/15826/Are-You-A-Power-Poisoned-Boss" title="Are You A Power-Poisoned Boss?">bring you down a notch</a> and say, <em>it takes two to converse! This is no lecture</em>. A conversation is about sharing <a href="http://www.martynemko.com/articles/do-you-talk-too-much_id1371" title="Do You Talk Too Much?">and paying attention to your conversation partner’s needs.</a></p>

<p>It is no surprise that by talking too much we may alienate our loved ones and friends from our lives. They’ll avoid us and our utterances at all times. It is this kind of behavior that we have to be  careful about.</p>

<p>Before Darwin it certainly was <a href="http://choiceindying.com/2011/03/02/could-you-be-an-intellectually-fulfilled-atheist-before-darwin/" title="Could you be an intellectually fulfilled atheist before Darwin? | Choice in Dying">very difficult to be an atheist</a> or a nonbeliever – that is, an intellectually fulfilled one.<sup id="fnref:fn1"><a href="#fn:fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> At least that’s how <a href="http://www.talkorigins.org/indexcc/CA/CA602_1.html" title="CA602.1: An intellectually fulfilled atheist">Richard Dawkins</a> usually puts it and I quite agree with him. It was not that the scientific method<sup id="fnref:fn2"><a href="#fn:fn2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> didn’t exist at the time, it was that the mystery of life was too big a mystery to even consider tackling through the ways of science. Yet that was what Darwin did. </p>

<p>The topic of this post does not have to do with Darwin, at least in a direct sense. The other day I was listening to <a href="http://www.pointofinquiry.org/" title="Point of Inquiry">Point of Inquiry</a>, a podcast from the center of inquiry.<sup id="fnref:fn5"><a href="#fn:fn5" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> They had <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frans_de_Waal" title="Frans de Waal - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">Frans de Waal</a> on and he talked about his latest book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Bonobo-Atheist-Humanism-ebook/dp/B007Q6XKEY"><em>The Bonobo and the Atheist</em></a>. There was a moment during the interview that the host, Chris Mooney, referred to him as being an atheist to which he replied saying </p>

<!-- more -->

<blockquote>
  <p>I am not necessarily an [atheist], because atheism has now come to stand for being very strongly opposed to religion which is really not what I am, I prefer to call my self either a <em>nonbeliever</em> or an <em>apathetic</em> meaning that, the agnostic doesn’t know if god exists, the atheist denies the existence of god, and <em>I basically don’t care</em>. I don’t think it is an important or interesting problem to discuss god. And as a scientist, I don’t know what to do with the god question. It will never be resolved, certainly not by science. </p>

  <p><strong>– Frans de Waal</strong>, On <a href="http://www.pointofinquiry.org/frans_de_waal_the_bonobo_and_the_atheist/">Point of Inquiry: Frans de Waal - The Bonobo and the Atheist</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can truly relate to his words. As much as I identify with people like Richard Dawkins or Sam Harris, being an atheist does not have to mean being opposed to religion. I can do that without being one. As a matter of fact religion and the institutions that promote it have done so much wrong to mankind that the logic behind them falls apart rather quickly. </p>

<p>What I can’t seem to get around my head is that despite that, religion is still a creation of humans and if I want to take the scientist’s approach I should accept it for what it is. That doesn’t mean, like de Wall suggests, that it cannot be replaced with something else. In his book, he argues that morality is something that is older than our species. Research suggests that many primates, and other animals, have a sense of morality. Meaning that they have impulses and self control mechanisms to resolve conflicts, to determine rules, etc. </p>

<p>In fact <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massimo_Pigliucci" title="Massimo Pigliucci - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">Massimo Pigliucci’s</a> book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Answers-Aristotle-Science-Philosophy-Meaningful/dp/0465021387"><em>Answers for Aristotle</em></a> attempts to solve that problem by saying that we should lead a life that is both philosophically and scientifically pertinent. Going back to the whole being opposed to religion issue, I say, denying god gets us nowhere. The existentialist questions still remain and it says nothing about what’s the best way to lead a life. Our society is too big and complex to pretend that we shouldn’t pursue such questions. However, we should use the best tools we’ve got for the job, and in the twenty-first century these are not religion or theology. </p>

<p>To conclude I would like to say that we shouldn’t really attack religion for what it is or for being wrong, we should instead try to show the way with the best tools we have. Resolving conflict without invoking god. Discussing real life issues with the best evidence we can find. Addressing our questions knowing wholeheartedly our limits. </p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the latest <a href="http://www.70decibels.com/generational/2013/3/24/027-aaron-hillegass-and-teaching-experts.html" title="70Decibels - Generational - 027 - Aaron Hillegass and Teaching Experts">Generational podcast</a> episode <a href="http://www.bignerdranch.com/instructors/hillegass.shtml">Aaron Hillegass</a> told <a href="http://www.macdrifter.com/" title="Macdrifter">Gabe</a> that he wrote his <a href="http://www.bignerdranch.com/book/objective-c_programming_the_big_nerd_ranch_guide">Objective-C</a> book with his ten-year-old in mind. </p>

<p>I found this to be quite interesting and truly inspiring. By writing the book “for his son,” he made sure anyone could actually read and understand it, but also he was deeply motivated to get it right. I wouldn’t want my son to read a crappy book. </p>

<p>If I ever had to write a guide about how to be (stay) motivated on a project this would definitely be there.</p>

    <updated>2013-03-10T21:44:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://andresmarrugo.net/blog/2013/03/10/a-brave-new-world</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>This post is in fact a <a href="http://dayoneapp.com/">Day One</a> entry. I treat my Day One journal as a sort of personal blog. A blog with a readership of one – at least in the present. What I mean to say is that, for the most part, I write about my life and for my kids, which are too young to read. I hope they read this in some distant future. I think that the things I might forget are probably the things they’ll want to know about. That is why I write.</em></p>

<!--more-->

<p><em>Occasionally I like to share and entry with my wife, which now Day One makes it so easy by offering the export to PDF option (<a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5279729/blog-pics/Screenshot%202013-03-10%20at%2008.49.51.png">click here</a> to see what the pdf looks like). Day One is an awesome app which inevitably has made me write more, reflect upon my thoughts and experiences both personal and with the people close to me. It has enabled something which I had lost, having conversations with myself, past and present, which I believe is part of being and feeling alive.</em></p>

<hr />

<p>I’ve been trying to teach Alejandro how to go down the stairs for several months now. For the most part it’s been an unfruitful endeavor, and not because he doesn’t want to go down the stairs; quite the contrary. He loves going down (or trying to go down) but walking right up on his two feet, like he sees everyone else doing it. </p>

<p>Just about every time I tried to show him how to slide his little butt, step by step, to go down safely, he would hurry down the stairs unafraid of falling. After a couple of months of no progress whatsoever I gave up, he can crawl up the stairs, but to go down I have to grab him while he pretends to go down like a grown-up. </p>

<p>Today that was different. I took him out to a nearby park so he could play outside in the sun. After riding his tricycle for about ten minutes he started to wander about in the park. Most of the times he wanders erratically, like going with the flow; chasing whatever is in his sight: a pigeon, a rock, a ball or another kid. </p>

<p>After a while he began to play going up and – with my help – down some stairs in the park. For him it was quite fun, for me a bit stressing because he can’t quite sense the danger in playing around stairs. </p>

<p>After several tries he – out of pure accident – stumbled upon a solution to go down the stairs in a fairly safe way. Sliding on his buttocks. He doesn’t speak yet, however I could sense in his eyes the satisfaction for having made a significant discovery, another way of doing things not known to him before. </p>

<p>I’m not making an argument for implying that he has a deep thought process like an adult, I know he doesn’t. Yet that feeling of true discovery was as vivid in his eyes as I see it in adults. I would say it is even more powerful, because he doesn’t  feel shame in expressing his feelings. He has no reason whatsoever to hide his ignorance. His discovery is genuine, as are his feelings. </p>

    <updated>2013-01-02T22:52:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://andresmarrugo.net/blog/2013/01/02/writing-my-thoughts-down</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="aic" style="width:500px"><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5279729/blog-pics/medium_3989921751.jpg" alt="iPod touch" /><br />

<p>As is often the case, ideas come about in the most unexpected moments. Lately, I’ve found myself taking notes while walking to work, while waiting for a coffee in front of a bending machine, or like now while getting dressed for work. </p>

<p>It’s become a habit of mine to write what I think, when I think it. My iPod touch has enabled that. I could well have pen and paper with me at all times, but I’m not used to that and nothing beats the digital format. </p>

<!--more-->

<p>I journal much more now than ever before, and that’s thanks to apps like <a href="http://dayoneapp.com/" title="Day One | A simple Journal for iPhone, iPad and Mac App Store">Day One</a> or <a href="http://agiletortoise.com/drafts" title="Drafts - Agile Tortoise">Drafts</a>. Writing  my thoughts down has never been easier. And, to tell you the truth, it’s <em>liberating</em>. It’s like <a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w/96" title="5by5 | Back to Work #96: Compensatory Muscles">Merlin Mann</a> says, “your brain has permission to think at all times.” And, as Melissa Donovan says in her book <a href="http://amzn.com/0615547850">101 Creative Writing Exercises</a>, “Journaling…promotes observation, self-awareness, and reflection, all skills that great writers must possess”, (by way of <a href="http://writeitsideways.com/learning-to-see-the-good-in-bad-writing/" title="Learning to See the Good in Bad Writing">Christi Craig</a>). My journaling has come a long way since I started using <a href="http://dayoneapp.com/" title="Day One | A simple Journal for iPhone, iPad and Mac App Store">Day One</a> last year. Some blog posts start there, or even certain personal emails too. Journaling helps me to reflect upon my thoughts and to make important decisions. </p>

<p>I’ve always been fond of writing, yet I’ve never had such an intimate relationship with my thoughts and my inner self. I believe that writing brings about the best in me. Through writing I can look at my human face and recognize my afflictions and ghosts. </p>

<p>Even as I sit here on my bed, tying my shoelaces, I feel an urge to get my thoughts out. I had never experienced this strong desire before. I, however, am totally aware that the more I write, the more I feel this urge. It’s quite fascinating and at times I just can’t help myself. </p>

<p>Happy new year to all my readers. Hope you had a nice time during the holidays and that you soon start your 2013 projects motivated and committed to getting things done – at least that’s my main purpose for this year.</p>

<p>I read the other day an email that desperately needed some editing. Writing without editing is pretty much the same as speaking with little attention to what we are saying. The great advantage of the <em>written form</em> over the spoken one is that you <em>can</em> go back an edit. Not editing what you write is both a poor use of the written form and a sign that you don’t care much for the person that will read your message. </p>

<!--more-->

<p>It’s not that a typo is not allowed, no one is perfect. But to write something without punctuation is just insane. All too often I hear people say that, because they are not writers or journalists they are somehow excused of writing poorly. I think it is just plain laziness. It’s a laziness that reads as our lack of interest for a craft so important to us by which we express what we feel and think.</p>

<p>How is it, that common sense doesn’t rouse in these situations? Why is it so difficult to realize that a 500+ word email written in a single paragraph without punctuation is just <em>illegible</em>. It costs so much to get the ideas out of that mess. The laziness to which I refer does service to no one, and buries even the meaning of your well-intended message.</p>

<p>So do yourself a favor and go back and edit the message a bit before hitting the send button.</p>

    <link href="http://andresmarrugo.net/blog/2012/12/07/cooking-ideas/"/>
    <updated>2012-12-07T21:02:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://andresmarrugo.net/blog/2012/12/07/cooking-ideas</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I love to cook – or one of the reasons I enjoy it so much is – because it’s a manual activity that, quite often, lets my mind wonder about. While cooking I can think about my problems,<sup id="fnref:fn1"><a href="#fn:fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> about the future, about a world different from this one. I can hear my thoughts in a undisturbed way. It is like a moment of pristine inspiration. Me and myself. Nobody else.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>I seldom write those thoughts down, because – well, it’s quite obvious – I’m cooking at the moment and if I did that, dinner would take forever to be ready. </p>

<p>So, as beautiful and inspiring the whole while-cooking thought process may be, it is <em>ephemeral</em>. As soon as dinner is ready I get back to the current issue and most of what was in my mind, just moments ago, vanishes – or so it seems. I think that on a subconscious level those thoughts do stick around. </p>

<p>What I certainly don’t like about cooking is the planning itself. If I want to cook chicken in the evening, and it’s in the fridge I have to remind myself to take it out in the morning – which quite often means I have to plan it the day before. And let’s be honest, having to think about getting chicken out of the fridge is not exactly the most intellectual thing one could be doing – yet, it’s got to happen and someone’s got to do it. </p>

<p>Except for that, cooking (to me) is quite a satisfactory experience which enables me to  enjoy myself and have an encounter with my thoughts and imagination. It’s (almost) like  day dreaming, but it’s not. It’s much more. </p>

    <id>http://andresmarrugo.net/blog/2012/11/16/my-reflection-in-a-mirror-of-prose</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I like to write, for writing reminds me of who I am, who I want to be, and where I come from. It is no mistery that I enjoy it, but that doesn’t make it any easier. </p>

<p>I often get compliments on my writing, but still, I think there’s a long way to go before I feel more comfortable with it – I still struggle over single words or sentences. </p>

<p>Lately, I’ve been rediscovering myself in many different ways. I find myself more aware of everything – and that is probably not the most interesting thing – if not by chance, by fate, but I do feel different. I certainly am not the same person I was a while ago. I write more, which means <em>I exit my body more often</em>. </p>

<!--more-->

<p>I write about my writing, for it serves as confession and a means to <em>see</em> my reflection in a mirror of prose. A reflection of what I think, and of who I am. It is no coincidence that by writing I often find answers to my problems or get a glance of the next step I should take. </p>

<p>Writing is <em>almost</em> certainly  not for everyone, at least in the sense of writing for the fun of it. I hardly know people – in person that is<sup id="fnref:fn1"><a href="#fn:fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> – that write out of pure pleasure, let alone people that <em>truly</em> make a living out of writing. </p>

<p>Writing is an art, but is also a skill. A skill that – despite natural talent – requires time and effort in developing. Like <a href="http://www.mcsweeneys.net/authors/colin-nissan">Colin Nissan</a> says in the <a href="http://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/the-ultimate-guide-to-writing-better-than-you-normally-do">“Ultimate guide to writing better than you normally do”</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Writing is a muscle. Smaller than a hamstring and slightly bigger than a bicep, and it needs to be exercised to get stronger. Think of your words as reps, your paragraphs as sets, your pages as daily workouts. Think of your laptop as a machine like the one at the gym where you open and close your inner thighs in front of everyone, exposing both your insecurities and your genitals. Because that is what writing is all about.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Yes, it’s about exposing yourself and becoming stronger in the process. </p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I don’t really know what this post is about or even why I decided it should be blog post in the first place. All I can think is that  I really liked it. I thought it would be interesting to share it with others. Not that it would be useful or anything, simply a pleasant read. </p>

<p>It’s not meant to mean anything in particular – at least in any philosophical way. It’s just something I conjured up the other day before going to bed. After I read it a couple of times, I knew it was a true gem. Only four paragraphs long, yet so deep with frustration and love. The love of a father towards his son, and of those little – apparently insignificant – moments that stick with you for the rest of your life. Here it is.</p>

<h2 id="a-very-short-midnight-story">A <em>very</em> short midnight story</h2>

<p><em>It’s almost midnight and I can’t really prevent my eyes from closing. I’m tired as hell, yet I can’t seem to convince myself into the idea that I should get some sleep.</em> </p>

<p><em>I don’t have a big day tomorrow or anything, it’s just that my kid wakes up so goddamn early. Well, that’s what he’s supposed to do, and I can’t find an argument against that – at least a plausible one.</em></p>

<p><em>Sometimes he just stays awake, lying there in my regular-sized bed, staring at me directly into my eyes, even though I have them closed, like waiting for the slightest  hint of evidence that I too, am awake.</em></p>

<p><em>At the first sight of a blink, he launches himself toward me. “Papa, papa,” he shouts with excitement. I open my eyes wide, he sticks his finger in one of them – it hurts.</em></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="to-tweet-or-not-to-tweet">To Tweet or Not to Tweet</h2>

<p>It always seems I’m late to the party. For several years I pondered on the idea of joining <a href="https://twitter.com/" title="Twitter">Twitter</a>, but it never really made much sense to me – at least at the time – to join a social network where there were hardly any friends of mine<sup id="fnref:fn1"><a href="#fn:fn1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. Big mistake, that actually <em>is</em> one of the cool things about twitter. Unlike Facebook, it <em>does</em> provides an open space suitable for engaging in discussions, albeit short, of all sorts with interesting people who don’t really have to be your “friend.”</p>

<p>It turns out that shortly after joining twitter most people<sup id="fnref:fn2"><a href="#fn:fn2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> were already considering abandoning it in favor of <a href="https://join.app.net/" title="Join the Movement - App.net">App.net</a>. For the time being <a href="https://join.app.net/" title="Join the Movement - App.net">App.net</a> seems like a <em>niche</em> thing, and most people seem to continue on twitter. Whether that stays that way for the next year or so depends on twitter and their recent policy changes that could well endanger the platform as we know it today. </p>

<h2 id="its-all-about-the-editor">It’s All About The Editor</h2>

<p>For quite a while it seemed that everywhere I looked, geeks where rejoicing and feeling proud of their text editor of choice: <a href="http://macromates.com/" title="TextMate — The Missing Editor for Mac OS X">Textmate</a>. I did look into it a couple of times, but I always thought it ways a bit too expensive for me. </p>

<p>For the most part it seemed I had always managed to get by with the tools at my disposal, I really didn’t feel like I needed something else.
I would use the builtin Matlab editor for writing Matlab code. As regards LaTeX – for writing papers – I would use the open source and free (as in beer) <a href="http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/" title="Texmaker (free cross-platform latex editor)">Texmaker</a>. I really wasn’t aware of the exciting and cool features of <em>advanced</em> text editors like Textmate or <a href="http://www.vim.org/" title="welcome home : vim online">Vim</a>. </p>

<p>For as long as I can remember, I’ve been a computer enthusiast, but a lone one. I never did have close friends that were into the sort of things I liked. I was never really ostracized, but I <em>was</em> the “nerd” nevertheless. </p>

<p>This brief digression is not without a purpose, which is to bring forth the fact that despite being a geek, I’ve never been part of a geek community of any sort. And this influenced my way of life and how I – before social networks – ended up finding out about the latest and coolest thing. More often than not, late and when it wasn’t really a <em>new</em> thing. The text editor dilemma is proof to my lack of geeky-social interaction.</p>

<p>Before I bought Textmate, I <em>did</em> do a little background check to see what was happening to its development. Apparently it was being not-so-actively developed, but version 2.0 was on the way. I had managed to somehow convince myself that it was totally worth it and that I would write my thesis with it. </p>

<p>Shortly after I bought it, it went open source, and to the impression of some: abandoned. It seems that for quite some time, everyone had been moving to Sublime text or BBEdit. Late to the party once again. I just can’t stop thinking that if somehow I had looked into it a bit more, if I had participated more on forums and different communities all of this would have ended differently. I <em>can</em> however say, that I am still using Textmate 1,  and I’m enjoying my self quite a bit.</p>

<h2 id="a-static-or-dynamic-blog">A Static or Dynamic Blog</h2>

<p>Technically speaking I’ve been bloggin since 2010. However, I must be honest and admit that for about the first year of my <a href="http://copiancestral.wordpress.com/" title="Between the Candle and the Star | Academia, Computing, and other topics.">(former) blog</a> I hardly posted a thing or two. It was a <a href="http://wordpress.com/" title="WordPress.com — Get a Free Blog Here">wordpress.com</a> blog and for nearly the last year or so, I began posting more regularly and I was really enjoying myself. I rapidly got accustomed to wordpress; so much, that I felt trapped in the platform, and I needed more customization to set things my way. Well, for the looks of it, I had to leave wordpress.com and move my blog somewhere else in order to do just that.</p>

<p>I kept blogging there, while I looked around to explore my options. It was interesting that this time I was <em>also</em> late, but not so much in the sense that I was able to catch a lot of people during their <a href="http://www.macdrifter.com/migrating-to-pelican-extracting-wordpress-data.html" title="Migrating to Pelican - Extracting WordPress Data">migration from a dynamic blog to a static one</a>. I’m not going to go through the details of why I chose a static blog, but it does have its advantages with respect to a dynamic one, like wordpress. </p>

<h2 id="getting-stuff-done">Getting Stuff Done</h2>

<p>As a final section for this already long post, I’d like to mention how I’ve also been late to the whole GTD movement (if there is such a thing). It’s amusing how shortly after I started to actually read David Allen’s book on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done" title="Getting Things Done - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">“Getting Things Done”</a>, some people were already arguing </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“whether GTD [was] valid after more than 10 years without any real “update”.”</p>

  <p>– <strong>Sven Fechner</strong>, <a href="http://simplicitybliss.com/the-state-of-getting-things-done" title="The State of Getting Things Done — SimplicityBliss">The State of Getting Things Done.</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can’t really say for my self, if it is still valid. I can, however, say that it still seems to make sense in the philosophy behind it, probably not so much in the methodology. But hey, what can I say, I haven’t even finished the <em>goddamn</em> book.</p>

<p>I’ve been late, as always, to many fascinating events of recent years – at least the geeky ones it seems. But I’ve come to accept that as a reality of mine. These days I can say that I try to keep myself more in the loop by following several interesting people on the web, whether it be via their blogs, twitter, or podcasts. This  seems a bit of a remedy to my bad timing, but hey everyone’s entitled to do things their way. I’m still struggling to actually find what <em>is</em> “my way”, but I’m in no hurry. There probably isn’t any <em>real</em> answer, <a href="http://www.macdrifter.com/2012/08/fiddle-sticks.html" title="Fiddle Sticks">I reckon the search is more valuable than the goal itself.</a></p>

    <id>http://andresmarrugo.net/blog/2012/10/18/image-to-pdf-with-automator-and-imagemagick</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I often use <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php">Imagemagick</a> for image manipulation<sup id="fnref:fn2"><a href="#fn:fn2" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. However, for simple conversion of an image to another format or similar things I have to go to the terminal and type something like the following</p>

<pre><code>convert somefile.png somefile.pdf
</code></pre>

<p>Which is quite simple, and much better than opening preview -&gt; export<sup id="fnref:fn1"><a href="#fn:fn1" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>-&gt;select pdf-&gt; and hit save. But typing that for more than one image is <em>also</em> tedious. So, I decided I’d better create a service that would essentially do the following.</p>

<p>It would take the selected finder items, mainly images in <code>png</code>, <code>jpeg</code>, or whatever, and convert all of them to <code>pdf</code>. Simple. <!--more-->  The automator service is shown in the following image. It does exactly what I’ve described.</p>

<div class="aic" style="width:500px"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/copiancestral/8099954950/" title="to-pdf-automator-script by copiancestral, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8045/8099954950_8d97fab95f.jpg" width="500" height="252" alt="to-pdf-automator-script" /></a><br />
Automator service.</div>

<p>The shell script is quite simple. Because the <code>convert</code> command from Imagemagick is not a command in bash, I have to call it with the whole path. The rest of that one-liner is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sed"><code>sed</code></a> call to substitute  whatever extension the input file has (with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression" title="Regular expression - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">regex</a> <code>\..*</code>) to <code>.pdf</code>, and that’s it. Here’s the script.</p>
