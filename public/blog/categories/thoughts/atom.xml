    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today in <a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/399/contents-unknown" title="Contents Unknown | This American Life">“This American Life”</a> I was listening to an episode about hidden truths. It was really interesting to find out about a secret letter that the prime minister of Britain writes to every commander of a nuclear submarine. It supposedly contains instructions on what to do if the nation has been wiped out and if the commander should retaliate or not. It poses a mystery on what the contents are, even more so because every time there’s a new prime minister in office the letters are destroyed unread.</p>

<p>There are many questions that come about in knowing what the contents of the letter are. But to my understanding it is a way of reassuring your people that both possibilities exist. To retaliate or not. It is like delaying the final call on a difficult decision. Something akin to a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schrodinger_cat" title="Schrödinger's cat - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia">Schrödinger cat situation</a>.  </p>

<p>I’ve thought of this for while and I’ve come to understand that many people actually <em>like</em> to live their lives this way. Not wanting to know certain things, or more precisely clinging to the hope that a certain aspect in one’s life does not turn out to be what we fear so much. Keeping both options open (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function" title="Wave function - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia"><em>not collapsing the wave function</em></a>) is probably a reassuring situation, relieving anxiety and allowing one to continue living unmoved by the cold hard reality. </p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="aic" style="width:500px"><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/5279729/blog-pics/medium_3989921751.jpg" alt="iPod touch" /><br />

<p>As is often the case, ideas come about in the most unexpected moments. Lately, I’ve found myself taking notes while walking to work, while waiting for a coffee in front of a bending machine, or like now while getting dressed for work. </p>

<p>It’s become a habit of mine to write what I think, when I think it. My iPod touch has enabled that. I could well have pen and paper with me at all times, but I’m not used to that and nothing beats the digital format. </p>

<!--more-->

<p>I journal much more now than ever before, and that’s thanks to apps like <a href="http://dayoneapp.com/" title="Day One | A simple Journal for iPhone, iPad and Mac App Store">Day One</a> or <a href="http://agiletortoise.com/drafts" title="Drafts - Agile Tortoise">Drafts</a>. Writing  my thoughts down has never been easier. And, to tell you the truth, it’s <em>liberating</em>. It’s like <a href="http://5by5.tv/b2w/96" title="5by5 | Back to Work #96: Compensatory Muscles">Merlin Mann</a> says, “your brain has permission to think at all times.” And, as Melissa Donovan says in her book <a href="http://amzn.com/0615547850">101 Creative Writing Exercises</a>, “Journaling…promotes observation, self-awareness, and reflection, all skills that great writers must possess”, (by way of <a href="http://writeitsideways.com/learning-to-see-the-good-in-bad-writing/" title="Learning to See the Good in Bad Writing">Christi Craig</a>). My journaling has come a long way since I started using <a href="http://dayoneapp.com/" title="Day One | A simple Journal for iPhone, iPad and Mac App Store">Day One</a> last year. Some blog posts start there, or even certain personal emails too. Journaling helps me to reflect upon my thoughts and to make important decisions. </p>

<p>I’ve always been fond of writing, yet I’ve never had such an intimate relationship with my thoughts and my inner self. I believe that writing brings about the best in me. Through writing I can look at my human face and recognize my afflictions and ghosts. </p>

<p>Even as I sit here on my bed, tying my shoelaces, I feel an urge to get my thoughts out. I had never experienced this strong desire before. I, however, am totally aware that the more I write, the more I feel this urge. It’s quite fascinating and at times I just can’t help myself. </p>

<p>Happy new year to all my readers. Hope you had a nice time during the holidays and that you soon start your 2013 projects motivated and committed to getting things done – at least that’s my main purpose for this year.</p>

<p>As Feynman spoke once of the science knowledge of a flower,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> I restate here in another context. There are many interesting questions that come from the knowledge of the backstory of the work of those we admire, which only adds to the excitement and mystery of the work itself. I don’t understand how it subtracts. </p>

<!--more-->

<p>Knowing the backstory makes a great deal of a difference. It sometimes shows you the  human being behind the curtains, and in many ways I truly think that this is good thing. </p>

<p>There are times when I might bring forth a piece of work of by someone I admire. That standalone piece may well be beautiful and quite unique, it may even require no explanation whatsoever, because it is truly a work of art. But then, when you start to grasp on the knowledge behind the work, when you try to unravel the mysteries, it only gets <em>way more</em> interesting. It’s almost like trying to take a peek inside the mind of a grandmaster in the very exact moment he makes a move. I may be exaggerating a little, but it seems so fascinating to be able to get a glimpse on how that amazing idea came to be.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.standard.co.uk/arts/van-gogh-and-his-demons-7418298.html">Whether it be demons</a> or just plain madness, many artists<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> struggle to get the screaming out of their heads, and some even succeed in translating such affliction into beautiful works of art. By trying to empathize with the people you admire, their work transcends to levels you couldn’t have foreseen. Their demons seem much more real to you, and some mysteries start fading away. The world is different, but it sort of makes sense. You feel like you’ve made a connection.</p>

<p>In getting to the backstory you appropriate the work, you make it part of who you are. It no longer is <em>just</em> another thing I read, saw, enjoyed, etc. Traditionally, the backstory to an artist was something not so easily accessible. Quite often I would find myself going through different sources, written posthumously and narrated with the voice of others to get a glance of the seemingly backstory. But things are changing, today I can follow someone in their true voice, in their first person narrated backstory. Today an artist can, and most, willingly convey their story via their personal platform: their web log. </p>

<p>I’ve gone into such length at writing this post because I feel proud of something. I feel proud of following a writer, a great guy by the looks of it, a self publisher,<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> and a contributor to the general conversation and the greater good on the internet. His name is <a href="http://cristianmihai.net/">Christian Mihai</a> and I really don’t remember how I stumbled upon his blog. But now he is on my favorite RSS feeds. This week he’s published a great book called <a href="http://amazon.com/dp/B009FVX9GW">“The Writer”</a> (it’s on sale in amazon). I bought it and so far, so good. Here’s a exceptional quote from the book</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>All great men are misfits, yet I couldn’t help but wonder what was worse: to be like everyone else or to be entirely different. I could only think about the fact that I needed a tragedy in my life, just so I could feel alive, just so my heart wouldn’t stop beating.</p>

  <p>– <strong><a href="http://amazon.com/dp/B009FVX9GW">The Writer, by Cristian Mihai</a></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<!-- - Merlin Mann on btw and mentioning about the backstory. 
- Getting closer to those you admire. 
- Cristian Mihai and "The Writer". 
	- Someone I follow, not necessarily admire. 
	- His book and several quotes. 
 -->

<!-- I think that everybody to get the screaming out of their heads do different things […] Half a dozen people beautiful losers and genius lunatics  There are these people who have created these things where part of what makes us admire them, there are people who make things that we really, really admire, and love and feel some kind of a resonance with because the work itself is fantastic, but there's another level to what they make when you know the backstory
