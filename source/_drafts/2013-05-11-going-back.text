## Going back

I grew up in a small city in the north coast of Colombia. When I was eight we went to to the US because my father was going to do a postdoc in Johns Hopkins. I went to school and learnt English. It was a remarkable time. I made new friends and everything was swell. After having lived two years in Maryland, we went back to Colombia. At that time my father insisted in that he would only flee his country if he wouldn't have the means to support his family to lead a decent and worthy life. I didn't really understand that at the time. Today I think I do.

I'm finishing my PhD in Barcelona...
