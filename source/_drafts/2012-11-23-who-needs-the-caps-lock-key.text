> The Capslock key on modern keyboard has become the punchline of many a joke, and for good reason: thereâ€™s no reason to dedicate such an important key to a function like capslock. Many people rebind it to a more useful key like Control, Option, Escape, or Backspace. I rebound it to Control for a while and then realized that with KeyRemap4MacBook I could get even more mileage out of it.

Zealous net newbies have also subjected the Caps Lock key to overuse, composing e-mails and newsgroup posts entirely in capital letters, an ugly and inelegant style of communication [akin to screaming][2]. 

uncomfortable finger combos

Well, now we're ready for the next step. Linus McCabe, founder of anticAPSLOCK, and myself are launching the [Million Dollar Keyboard competition][3]. The goal is simple: to raise a million bucks and give it to the person who designs the best new keyboard layout to replace the old ISO9995 standard. 


It makes great remapping to `Ctrl` so that you don't have to strain your pinkies by trying to get all the way to the corners.


> YOU MAY FIND THE CAPS LOCK USEFUL IF YOU WANT TO ANNOY LOTS OF PEOPLE BY WRITING A WHOLE SENTENCE IN CAPITAL LETTERS, PARTICULARLY IF YOU WANT TO WRITE A LONG SENTENCE IN SUCH A MANNER, ALTHOUGH I BELIEVE THAT SHORT SENTENCES WRITTEN IN CAPITALS ARE ALSO ANNOYING TO LOOK AT.
