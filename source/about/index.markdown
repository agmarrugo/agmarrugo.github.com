## About this site ##

This site is made of pure HTML, built and published with [Octopress][octopress]. Every post is written in [Markdown][daringfireball]. My host is [Github][github] and the repository is public, so feel free [to check it out][github 2] if you want to see the source. 

An interesting thing about this site is that it is basically two [Octopress][octopress] sites on one domain. I did this because I wanted a multilingual site, without having to mix the content. So the site you're reading is [andresmarrugo.net][andresmarrugo] the English one, and the other in spanish is [andresmarrugo.net/es][andresmarrugo 2].

I've customized the appearance of the site a bit. A great part is based on the [DarkStripes][melandri] theme by [Alessandro Melandri][melandri 2]. The background is [3px tile][subtlepatterns] from the wonderful [Subtle Patterns][subtlepatterns 2] site.
