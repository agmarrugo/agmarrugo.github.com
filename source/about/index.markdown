My name is Andrés Marrugo, and I'm a PhD student in optical engineering at the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC) in Barcelona, Spain. I work at the [group of Applied Optics and Image Processing][goapi] and my main line of research is in medical image processing.

These days I spend most of my time working on my thesis and at home with my girlfriend and my one-year-old son. Becoming a father has been an amazing experience, it has really changed my life and the way I look upon life itself. When I'm not being the *family guy* or the *grad student*, I'm usually fiddling around at the terminal (doing geeky stuff), editing photos/videos of my boy, cooking (I love to cook), writing on my journal, catching up on my RSS feeds and podcasts, and blogging[^foo].

Since 2010 I've been blogging on [Between the Candle and the Star][wordpress] a blog hosted on [wordpress.com][wordpress 2]. It's great, but it's not so much customizable and I was looking for something a bit different. That's why I changed to an [Octopress][octopress] powered site.

## About this site ##

This site is made of pure HTML, built and published with [Octopress][octopress]. Every post is written in [Markdown][daringfireball]. My host is [Github][github] and the repository is public, so feel free [to check it out][github 2] if you want to see the source. 

An interesting thing about this site is that it is basically two [Octopress][octopress] sites on one domain. I did this because I wanted a multilingual site, without having to mix the content. So the site you're reading is [andresmarrugo.net][andresmarrugo] the English one, and the other in spanish is [andresmarrugo.net/es][andresmarrugo 2].

I've customized the appearance of the site a bit. A great part is based on the [DarkStripes][melandri] theme by [Alessandro Melandri][melandri 2]. The background is [3px tile][subtlepatterns] from the wonderful [Subtle Patterns][subtlepatterns 2] site.
