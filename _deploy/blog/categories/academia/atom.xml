<p>A Ph.D. thesis is one of those things that has a life of its own. Last January, I had the opportunity to write a two-page abstract of my thesis for publication in <em>Electronic Letters on Computer Vision and Image Analysis</em>. It has been published and is now <a href="http://elcvia.cvc.uab.es/article/view/597" title="Retinal Image Analysis Oriented to the Clinical Task - Marrugo - Electronic Letters on Computer Vision and Image Analysis">available on the web along with the PhD thesis.</a></p>

<p>The paper is only a glimpse of all the hard work that went into the making of the thesis, but anyone who reads it may get a decent idea of what it is about, and where to find the results I’ve published in different journals. I don’t think anyone wants to go through the process of writing a thesis twice, but most will agree that it is a life changing experience. Many of the best moments of my life so far, happened while working towards the PhD, especially the birth of my two boys. </p>
